# RSdiscordbot
A Discord Bot to list active users during live events on discord.

A simple bot that has three lists.  Everytime a user sends a message it stores the name of that user unless the name is already in the list. 
By using the commands !rundown1 !rundown2 and !rundown3 you are able to see who has been chatting
over the last hour, two hours or three hours.
Lists clear themselves after 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours.
